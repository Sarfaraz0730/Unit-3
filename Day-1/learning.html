/*    
Create a mini Js datatype learning app.
    Create buttons namely ‘Objects’, ‘Arrays’, ‘Functions’, ‘Strings’, ‘Numbers’, ‘null’, ‘undefined’ in index.html.
    On clicking any respective button, the user should be able to see 5-6 bullet-point information about that particular datatype.
    For e.g If I click on ‘Object’, I should see information about Js objects like what are objects, how they work, mutability, etc.
    Be creative! */
